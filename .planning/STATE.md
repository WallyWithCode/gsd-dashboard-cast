## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting v2.0 work:

- v2.0 Phase 10-03: self.encoder instance variable pattern - encoder name stored in __init__ for cross-method access between build_ffmpeg_args() and __aenter__() logging
- v2.0 Phase 10-03: ICQ mode (global_quality) for h264_qsv - QuickSync uses global_quality=23 with look_ahead instead of bitrate/preset (they conflict)
- v2.0 Phase 10-03: Empty encoder_args for libx264 fallback - reuses existing preset/bitrate config from encoder.py, avoids duplication
- v2.0 Phase 10-02: Three-step hardware detection - checks ffmpeg -encoders for h264_qsv, vainfo device access for /dev/dri/renderD128, and VAEntrypointEncSlice capability
- v2.0 Phase 10-02: Cached detection results - _qsv_available instance variable caches result for performance (check once per encoder lifecycle)
- v2.0 Phase 10-02: Graceful degradation pattern - return False (not exceptions) when hardware unavailable, log at WARNING level for fallback scenarios
- v2.0 Phase 10-01: Simplified FFmpeg installation - python:3.11-slim already includes FFmpeg 7.1.3 with h264_qsv support, no Debian testing repository needed
- v2.0 Phase 10-01: intel-media-va-driver package name - correct package in Debian Trixie (not intel-media-va-driver-non-free)
- v2.0 Phase 10-01: LIBVA_DRIVER_NAME=iHD environment variable - forces iHD driver selection for Gen 8+ Intel GPUs
- v2.0 Phase 10-01: Placeholder GID values with helper script - makes docker-compose.yml portable across different host systems
- v2.0 Roadmap: QuickSync moved from Phase 13 to Phase 10 — CPU bottleneck discovered during testing (2-vCPU VM insufficient for software encoding), prioritize hardware acceleration to enable working demonstration
- v2.0 Phase 9: FFmpeg log task cancelled BEFORE process.terminate() — Prevents BrokenPipeError from reading closed pipe
- v2.0 Phase 9: Level-based FFmpeg logging (ERROR/WARNING/DEBUG/INFO) — Classifies output by content keywords
- v2.0 Phase 9: FFmpeg stderr-only reading — All FFmpeg output goes to stderr, stdout contains stream data
- v2.0 Phase 9: HLS buffer window increased from 20s to 40s (hls_list_size 10→20) — Prevents Cast device underruns during streaming
- v2.0 Phase 9: Added hls_delete_threshold=5 — Retains segments beyond playlist for buffering safety
- v2.0 Phase 9: Added omit_endlist flag — Signals continuous streaming mode to Cast devices (not VOD)
- v2.0 Phase 9: Startup cleanup in __init__ method — Removes stale HLS segments before new sessions
- v1.1: aiohttp over FastAPI StaticFiles — Independent server on configurable port (enables 8000/8080 separation)
- v1.1: fMP4 movflags: frag_keyframe+empty_moov+default_base_moof — Streaming-friendly fragmentation
- v1.1: Default mode 'hls' — Backward compatibility with existing webhooks
- v1.0: Software encoding for v1 — Hardware acceleration deferred to v2.0 (QuickSync/VAAPI integration)

### Pending Todos

3 todos pending. See `.planning/todos/pending/`

- **Direct RTSP to Cast streaming** — bypass browser capture for camera feeds (video)
- **Hardware acceleration (QuickSync/VAAPI)** — reduce CPU usage for FFmpeg encoding (v2.0 Phase 13)
- **FFmpeg process cleanup bug** — multiple FFmpeg processes spawned, not cleaned up on error (v2.0 Phase 12)

### Resolved Todos

- **FFmpeg subprocess logging** — ✅ RESOLVED in Phase 9 (GAP-09-01: FFmpeg stdout/stderr now forwarded to application logs with level-based classification)
- **HLS stream buffering issue** — ✅ RESOLVED in Phase 9 (HLS buffer window increased to 40s, segment retention added, continuous streaming signal implemented)

### Blockers/Concerns

**v2.0 addresses these known issues:**
- Orphaned FFmpeg processes (Phase 12 target)
- CPU-bound software encoding (Phase 13 target)

**Resolved in v2.0:**
- ✅ FFmpeg diagnostic gap (Phase 9 - GAP-09-01 closed, subprocess logging now captured)
- ✅ HLS 6-second freeze bug (Phase 9 - buffer window and segment retention fixed)

**Resolved in previous milestones:**
- Cast device 404 errors (Phase 8 - IP address fixed)
- WSL2 mDNS limitation (v1.0 - static IP workaround documented)

## Session Continuity

Last session: 2026-01-19 (Phase 10-02 complete: Hardware Detection Module)
Stopped at: Completed 10-02-PLAN.md execution with user verification
Resume with: Continue Phase 10 planning/execution (next plan: 10-04 Testing)
Resume file: None

### Context for Next Session
- Phase 10-03 complete: FFmpeg encoder integration with hardware acceleration
  - FFmpegEncoder imports and uses HardwareAcceleration class
  - Encoder dynamically selects h264_qsv or libx264 based on hardware availability
  - Conditional rate control: ICQ mode (global_quality) for QSV, bitrate/preset for libx264
  - Health endpoint reports hardware acceleration status (quicksync_available, encoder)
  - Encoder name logged in startup messages for debugging
- Phase 10-02 complete: Hardware detection module (SUMMARY created)
  - HardwareAcceleration class with runtime QuickSync detection via vainfo
  - Three-step verification: ffmpeg encoder, vainfo device access, VAEntrypointEncSlice
  - Graceful fallback to software encoding when hardware unavailable
  - Exception handling verified (FileNotFoundError, TimeoutExpired)
  - User verification passed: software fallback works, service starts successfully
- Phase 10-01 complete: Docker infrastructure configured for Intel QuickSync
  - FFmpeg 7.1.3 with h264_qsv encoder verified in container
  - Intel iHD VAAPI drivers installed
  - GPU device passthrough configured (/dev/dri)
- **User action required before testing:**
  - Run scripts/detect-gpu-gids.sh to get render and video GIDs
  - Replace placeholder values in docker-compose.yml group_add section
  - Verify /dev/dri device exists on host system
  - Confirm Intel GPU with QuickSync support available (lspci | grep -i vga)
- **Next steps for Phase 10:**
  - Plan 10-04: Test hardware acceleration with actual GPU, verify performance improvement
  - Verify software fallback works correctly
  - Check health endpoint reports correct encoder status
- **Technical notes:**
  - ICQ mode quality target: global_quality=23 (similar to CRF)
  - Look-ahead enabled for h264_qsv: 40-frame depth
  - libx264 fallback uses existing preset/bitrate config from encoder.py
