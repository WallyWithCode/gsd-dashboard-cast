# Dashboard Cast Service - Environment Variables
# Copy this file to .env if you need to customize any variables

# ============================================================================
# REQUIRED VARIABLES (Set automatically in docker-compose.yml)
# ============================================================================

# Virtual display for Xvfb (managed by XvfbManager in Python code)
# Do not change this unless you have a specific reason
DISPLAY=:99

# Enable real-time log streaming (recommended for Docker containers)
PYTHONUNBUFFERED=1

# ============================================================================
# OPTIONAL VARIABLES (Cast Device Configuration)
# ============================================================================

# Static IP address for Cast device (bypasses mDNS discovery)
# Use this if mDNS discovery fails in your environment (e.g., WSL2/Docker)
# Example: CAST_DEVICE_IP=10.10.0.31
# CAST_DEVICE_IP=

# Alternative: Discover Cast device by friendly name instead of static IP
# Use this if you want to discover by name rather than IP
# Example: CAST_DEVICE_NAME="Living Room TV"
# CAST_DEVICE_NAME=

# ============================================================================
# NOTES
# ============================================================================

# WSL2 mDNS Limitation:
# If running in WSL2, mDNS multicast packets don't forward through the
# virtualized NAT network. This prevents automatic Cast device discovery.
# Workaround: Set CAST_DEVICE_IP to your Cast device's static IP address.
# The IP can be found in your Cast device settings or router DHCP leases.

# Priority:
# If both CAST_DEVICE_IP and CAST_DEVICE_NAME are set, CAST_DEVICE_IP takes
# precedence and mDNS discovery is skipped entirely.
